```Ruby
a = 4
b = 2

2.times do |a|
  a = 5
  puts a
end

puts a
puts b
```
The code will output `5`, `5`, `4`, `2`, each on a separate line.

On line 1, local variable `a` is initialized and references an integer object with the value `4`. On line 2, local variable `b` is initialized and references the integer object `2`.

On line 4, the `times` method is called on the integer `2` and is passed a `do...end` block (lines 4 - 7) as an argument, with 1 parameter: `a`. Within each iteration of the block, the iteration number, referenced by the block parameter `a`, is reassigned to the integer `5`. This is then passed as an argument to the `puts` method, which outputs `5` to the console. Because there are 2 iterations of the block, this is performed twice.

On lines 9-10, local variables `a` and `b` are passed as arguments to the `puts` method, which outputs their values to the console. Because the block only used its parameter `a` throughout its operation, the local variables initialized on lines 1 and 2 were never reassigned.

This example demonstrates how **variable shadowing** can prevent access to the outer scope of a block due to using the same variable names throughout a codebase. When searching for a local variable, Ruby looks within the block's scope first, then moves outward, returning the first reference it finds.
